## 🌍 Global Positioning Strategy

### Market Scope
**SmartyGym operates as a WORLDWIDE fitness platform with NO geographical limitations.**

### Strategic Positioning Changes (January 2025)
- ✅ **FROM**: Cyprus-focused fitness brand
- ✅ **TO**: Global online fitness platform
- ✅ **Removed**: All Cyprus/location-specific branding from:
  - Website content and SEO metadata
  - Structured data (JSON-LD schemas)
  - Marketing copy and descriptions
  - App store listings
  - Legal documents (using "applicable law" instead)

### Geographic References - Critical Rules

**REMOVED FROM ALL CONTENT:**
- ❌ "Cyprus fitness", "Cyprus gym", "online gym Cyprus"
- ❌ "Cyprus-based", "Cyprus leading", "based in Cyprus"
- ❌ Geographic meta tags (geo.region, geo.placename, geo.position)
- ❌ addressCountry: "CY" in structured data (use "areaServed": "Worldwide")
- ❌ Location-specific SEO keywords

**ONE EXCEPTION:**
- ✅ **Coach Haris Falas's Personal CV** (`src/pages/CoachCV.tsx`)
  - May contain his factual biographical information
  - Includes his actual residence (Cyprus)
  - Lists his education (Frederick University, Cyprus)
  - Details his professional memberships (Cyprus National Olympic Committee)
  - This is FACTUAL PERSONAL HISTORY, not brand positioning

### Legal Language (Global Positioning)
Use globally applicable language in all legal documents:
- ✅ "applicable law"
- ✅ "EU regulations and applicable data protection laws"
- ✅ "jurisdiction where you reside"
- ✅ "international data transfer regulations"
- ❌ NOT "Cyprus law", "Cypriot regulations", etc.
