## App Store Optimization (ASO) Notes

### Keyword Optimization Strategy:
1. **High-volume keywords:** fitness, workout, gym, training
2. **Long-tail keywords:** personal trainer app, HIIT workout generator, custom workout plan
3. **Competitor keywords:** NOT allowed to use competitor names
4. **Local keywords:** Not applicable (global app)

### Conversion Optimization:
- Icon: Shows SmartyGym logo clearly
- Screenshots: Show key features (workout library, training programs, dashboard)
- First screenshot is most important - use workout library hero
- Use captions on screenshots to highlight features
- Emphasize "100% Human. 0% AI." differentiation

### A/B Testing Ideas (after launch):
- Test different subtitle variations
- Test screenshot order
- Test promotional text variations
- Monitor keyword performance and adjust
