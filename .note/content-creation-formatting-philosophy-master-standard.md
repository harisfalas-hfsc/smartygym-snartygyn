# Content Creation Formatting Philosophy - Master Standard

## CRITICAL: This is the definitive formatting standard for ALL content

Based on user's "Functional Foundations" program as the reference template.

## Core Principles

1. **Start Immediately** - Content begins on the FIRST line. NO empty paragraphs at the start. User sees content instantly.

2. **Compact & Readable** - User grasps structure in 2-3 seconds without scrolling through whitespace.

3. **Clear Visual Hierarchy** - Week → Day → Exercises with breathing room between SECTIONS, not between items.

## Exact Formatting Rules

### Week Titles
- **Bold + Underlined**
- ONE empty paragraph AFTER the title
- Example: `<p><strong><u>Week 1: Foundation Phase</u></strong></p>` then `<p></p>`

### Day Titles  
- **Bold + Underlined**
- ONE empty paragraph AFTER the title before exercises
- Example: `<p><strong><u>Day 1 - Movement Mastery:</u></strong></p>` then `<p></p>`

### Exercise Lists
- Numbered format: `1. Exercise Name – description – sets/reps`
- **NO spaces between exercises** within the same day block
- Exercises flow as a tight, continuous list
- Exercise name should be bold within the number: `<strong>1. Exercise Name</strong> – description`

### Between Days
- ONE empty paragraph after the last exercise of a day
- Then the next day title appears

### Section Titles (Description, Overview, etc.)
- Bold + Underlined
- ONE empty paragraph after

## What This Applies To
- All training programs
- All workouts (regular and WODs)
- All AI-generated content
- Any content with structured sections

## Visual Example Structure
```
<p><strong><u>Week 1: Title</u></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Day 1 - Focus:</u></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Exercise A</strong> – description – 3x10</p>
<p><strong>2. Exercise B</strong> – description – 3x12</p>
<p><strong>3. Exercise C</strong> – description – 3x8</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Day 2 - Focus:</u></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Exercise D</strong> – description – 4x8</p>
...
```

## Absolute Rules
- NEVER start content with empty paragraphs
- NEVER put spaces between individual exercises
- ALWAYS put ONE space after section/day titles
- ALWAYS put ONE space between day blocks
- Content must be immediately visible and scannable
