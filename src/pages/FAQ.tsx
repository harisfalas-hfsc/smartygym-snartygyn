                      A <strong>workout</strong> is a standalone training session designed for a specific goal — whether that's calorie burning, 
                      strength building, cardio conditioning, mobility work, or power development. It's perfect when you want a single, 
                      focused session or when you're mixing and matching your own training plan.<br/><br/>
                      
                      A <strong>training program</strong> is a complete, structured plan that spans multiple weeks (e.g., 4, 6, or 12 weeks). 
                      It includes progressive training phases, periodization, recovery strategies, and a clear roadmap toward a specific goal 
                      (like building strength, losing fat, or improving performance). Programs are ideal if you want a full training cycle 
                      with built-in progression and accountability.
