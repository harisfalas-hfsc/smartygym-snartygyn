          </h2>

            SmartyGym is built around eight coach-crafted pillars that together cover
            strength, hypertrophy, conditioning, mobility, habit-building and community —
            everything a real training program needs, delivered anywhere.

            Why Human-Designed Beats Automated
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Generic fitness apps generate workouts by algorithm. SmartyGym does the
            opposite: every session is programmed by a Sports Scientist with 20+ years of
            coaching experience across strength, hypertrophy, conditioning and rehab. That
            means real progressive overload, real periodization, real technique cues and
            real accountability — the kind of coaching that used to only exist in-person.
